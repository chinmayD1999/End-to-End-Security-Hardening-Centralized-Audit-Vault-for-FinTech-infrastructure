## 1.Project Overview


### 1.1 Introduction

In modern enterprise environments, traditional "castle-and-moat" security models—where everything inside the network is trusted—are no longer sufficient. Sophisticated threats often originate from compromised internal nodes or stolen physical hardware.

This project, **"End to End Security Hardening Centralized Audit Vault for FinTech infrastructure"** simulates a high-security, critical infrastructure environment typical of the Fintech or Defense sectors. By deploying a strictly **Offline** network, the project completely isolates sensitive data from the public internet. It utilizes **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9)** to build a robust architecture that prioritizes identity governance, immutable logging, and automated encryption over convenience.

### 1.2 Objective: Zero Trust & Centralized Security

The primary objective is to implement a **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** where no device is implicitly trusted, even if it is physically located inside the secure datacenter.

The system is designed around two core security pillars:

1. **Centralized Dependency:** The Workload Node (Web Client) is intentionally "helpless." It cannot resolve users, unlock its own hard drives, or store logs without active authorization from the Control Plane (Infra Server).
2. **Cryptographic Verification:** Every interaction—whether it is a user logging in, a disk unlocking, or a file being shared—is verified using military-grade cryptography (Kerberos, LUKS, RSA).

**Key Security Goals:**

* **Data at Rest:** Ensure data on stolen physical disks is unreadable (via NBDE).
* **Data in Transit:** Ensure network traffic cannot be sniffed or spoofed (via Kerberized NFS).
* **Non-Repudiation:** Ensure that if a breach occurs, the attacker cannot delete the forensic evidence (via Remote Audit Logging).

### 1.3 Scope of Work

This project encompasses the full lifecycle of designing, deploying, and hardening a Linux infrastructure. The scope includes:

* **Network Design:** Implementation of an isolated Host-Only network (`192.168.70.0/24`) with strict firewalling.
* **Identity Management:** Deployment of Red Hat IdM (FreeIPA) for centralized authentication and policy enforcement.
* **Storage Automation:** Configuration of Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) using Tang and Clevis.
* **Forensics Engineering:** Setup of `auditd` for deep system monitoring and `rsyslog` for centralized log aggregation.
* **Vulnerability Testing:** Execution of simulated "theft" and "intrusion" scenarios to validate the security controls.

**Out of Scope:**

* Connecting the infrastructure to the public internet.
* Deployment of user-facing web applications (the focus is on the *infrastructure*, not the website content).
* Cloud-based integration (AWS/Azure) – this is strictly an on-premise simulation.

## 2.System Architecture & Design

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture (The "Control Plane" vs. "Workload Node")

<p align="center">
  <img src="Architecture.png" width="850">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Zero Trust Isolated Architecture</em>
</p>

Here is the drafted content for **Section 2.2**, detailing the specific network layer of your infrastructure.

---

### 2.2 Network Topology: The Offline Environment (192.168.70.0/24)

To adhere to the strict "Zero Trust" requirement, the infrastructure is deployed within a fully isolated **Host-Only Network**. This topology simulates a high-security "Dark Site" or air-gapped datacenter where servers have no physical or logical path to the public internet.

#### **Network Specifications**

* **Network Type:** Host-Only (VMware VMnet2)
* **Subnet CIDR:** `192.168.70.0/24`
* **Broadcast Address:** `192.168.70.255`
* **Default Gateway:** None (Intentionally omitted to prevent internet routing).

#### **IP Addressing Scheme**

Static IP addresses were assigned to ensure consistent connectivity for cryptographic services (Kerberos/Tang) which rely on DNS stability.

| Device Role | Hostname | IP Address | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Management Host** | *Physical Laptop* | `192.168.70.1` | The "Jump Box" or Admin workstation. It is the only device capable of SSHing into the environment. |
| **Control Plane** | `infra.chinmaytech.local` | `192.168.70.10` | The primary DNS and Identity server. |
| **Workload Node** | `web01.chinmaytech.local` | `192.168.70.20` | The application server. |

Here is the drafted content for **Section 2.3**. This section dives deep into the specific software stack installed on each server, explaining *what* is running and *why*.

---

### 2.3 Component Breakdown

This section details the software stack and service roles configured on each node. The architecture relies on specific Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) subsystems to enforce the Zero Trust model.

#### **2.3.1 Infra Server (Control Plane)**

* **Hostname:** `infra.chinmaytech.local`
* **Role:** The immutable "Trust Anchor." It hosts the authoritative source for all data, identities, and keys.

| Component / Service | Daemon Name | Function in Zero Trust Architecture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Red Hat IdM** | `ipa-server` | The Centralized Identity Provider. It combines LDAP (User DB), MIT Kerberos (Authentication), and BIND (DNS) into a single controller. |
| **Tang Server** | `tangd` | The "Key Escrow" service. It listens on Port 7500 and serves cryptographic keys to authorized clients, enabling Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE). |
| **NFS Server** | `nfs-server` | Provides the network file share (`/share/finance`). Configured with `sec=krb5p` to enforce strict Kerberos ticket validation and packet encryption. |
| **Rsyslog Receiver** | `rsyslog` | Configured as a centralized log collector (TCP/UDP 514). It receives security alerts from the client and stores them in the immutable vault. |
| **Secure Vault** | `dm-crypt` | A 10GB LUKS-encrypted partition (`/secure_audit`) unlocked via a local root-protected keyfile, ensuring sensitive logs are encrypted at rest. |
| **Local Repo** | `httpd` | A local HTTP server hosting the RHEL 9 ISO content, allowing the Web Client to install software without internet access. |

---

#### **2.3.2 Web Client (Workload Node)**

* **Hostname:** `web01.chinmaytech.local`
* **Role:** The "Application Node." It is stateless and dependent on the Infra Server for operational security.

| Component / Service | Daemon Name | Function in Zero Trust Architecture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SSSD** | `sssd` | The Client Side Agent. It connects to the Infra Server to cache user credentials and enforce login policies (HBAC). |
| **Apache Web Server** | `httpd` | The business application. Runs on Port 80. Access to the underlying OS is restricted via sudo rules managed by IdM. |
| **Clevis** | `clevis-luks` | The "Unlocker." A client-side framework that contacts the Tang server during boot to automatically decrypt the LUKS partition. |
| **NFS Security** | `rpc-gssd` | The RPC GSS Daemon. It handles the Kerberos context switching, allowing the NFS client to present a "Ticket" instead of just an IP address. |
| **Linux Audit** | `auditd` | The "Camera." Configured with kernel-level rules to watch specific files (`/etc/shadow`, `/etc/sysconfig/network`) for unauthorized changes. |
| **Log Forwarder** | `rsyslog` | Configured to forward `*.*` (all logs) to `192.168.70.10:514` immediately, ensuring no evidence remains solely on the compromised host. |

---

### **2.3.3 The Dependency Map**

The breakdown highlights the **Critical Dependencies** created by this design:

1. If **Tang (`tangd`)** stops, the Web Client cannot boot (Disk Encryption fails).
2. If **IdM (`ipa-server`)** stops, no one can log in to the Web Client (Authentication fails).
3. If **RPC GSS (`rpc-gssd`)** stops, the File Share vanishes (Decryption fails).

This centralization reduces the "Attack Surface" of the Web Client to near zero, as it holds no persistent secrets.

Here is the drafted content for **Section 2.4**. This section provides a technical inventory of the specific software versions and tools used to build the solution.

---

### 2.4 Software & Tools Specification

The solution utilizes a standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 software stack, leveraging native kernel capabilities to minimize reliance on third-party tools.

#### **2.4.1 Core Infrastructure**

| Category | Software / Tool | Version | Purpose in Architecture |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Operating System** | **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** | **9.3** | The base OS chosen for its "Secure by Design" defaults and support for FIPS-140-3 validation. |
| **Kernel** | **Linux Kernel** | **5.14+** | Provides the underlying `dm-crypt` (encryption) and `audit` (logging) subsystems. |
| **Virtualization** | **VMware Workstation Pro** | **17.x** | The hypervisor used to host the air-gapped environment and manage the virtual Host-Only network (`VMnet2`). |

#### **2.4.2 Security & Cryptography Stack**

| Tool | Component Role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LUKS2** | *Disk Encryption* | **Linux Unified Key Setup (v2).** Used to encrypt the partition headers. Unlike LUKS1, it supports Argon2id hashing for resistance against GPU brute-force attacks. |
| **Tang** | *Key Escrow Server* | A lightweight web service (running on `infra`) that binds data to the network presence. It uses **Jose** (JSON Object Signing and Encryption). |
| **Clevis** | *Decryption Client* | The "glue" framework that runs at boot time. It automates the unlocking process by solving the cryptographic puzzle presented by Tang. |
| **GnuPG** | *Key Management* | Used for generating and managing the SSH keys and verifying package signatures from the local repository. |

#### **2.4.3 Identity & Access Management (IAM)**

| Tool | Component Role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Red Hat IdM** | *Domain Controller* | Powered by **FreeIPA**. It manages the centralized HBAC (Host-Based Access Control) rules, ensuring only specific users can login to specific terminals. |
| **MIT Kerberos** | *Authentication Protocol* | Eliminates the transmission of passwords over the network. It issues "Tickets" (TGT) that allow services to trust each other without exchanging secrets. |
| **SSSD** | *Client Agent* | **System Security Services Daemon.** It handles the offline caching of credentials, allowing a user to login even if the IdM server is temporarily unreachable (cached credentials). |

#### **2.4.4 Forensics & Networking**

| Tool | Component Role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Auditd** | *Kernel Auditing* | The Linux Audit Framework. It intercepts system calls directly from the kernel (e.g., `open`, `execve`) to generate immutable evidence of user activity. |
| **Rsyslog** | *Log Transport* | Configured with the **RELP (Reliable Event Logging Protocol)** concept to ensure logs are successfully transmitted to the Infra server before being discarded from the client buffer. |
| **Firewalld** | *Network Defense* | Uses **Rich Rules** to enforce granular traffic control (e.g., "Allow Port 80 only from Subnet X") rather than simple zone-based blocking. |

#### **2.4.5 Management Utilities**

* **Cockpit:** A web-based graphical interface used for performance monitoring and visualizing the storage logs.
* **LVM2:** Logical Volume Manager, used to create flexible storage groups for the encrypted vaults.
* **OpenSSH:** Configured with strict `PermitRootLogin no` (except via console) to enforce the use of unprivileged accounts.

Here is the drafted content for **Section 3: Phase 1 - Infrastructure Foundation**. This section documents the initial build-out of the "Dark Site" environment.

---

## 3. Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation

The first phase focused on establishing a secure, isolated baseline. Before deploying any security tools, we built the "Digital Bunker"—an environment physically disconnected from the public internet but fully functional internally.

### 3.1 Environment Setup (VMware Host-Only Network)

To simulate a true air-gapped datacenter, we configured a dedicated virtualization network that prohibits all external traffic (NAT/Bridged).

* **Virtual Switch:** VMware **VMnet2**
* **Mode:** **Host-Only** (No routing to physical NIC)
* **Subnet:** `192.168.70.0/24`
* **Rationale:** This creates a strict boundary. Even if the host machine has internet, the VMs cannot route traffic out, and external attackers cannot route traffic in.

### 3.2 Infra Server Deployment (Control Plane)

The **Infra Server** was deployed first to serve as the backbone of the network.

* **OS:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.3
* **Hostname:** `infra.chinmaytech.local`
* **IP Configuration:**
* **IP Address:** `192.168.70.10`
* **Gateway:** None (Blank)
* **DNS:** `127.0.0.1` (It is its own DNS server)


* **Post-Install Hardening:**
* Set **SELinux** to Enforcing.
* Configured **Firewalld** to drop all incoming connections except SSH from the Management IP (`192.168.70.1`).



### 3.3 Web Client Deployment (Workload Node)

The **Web Client** was deployed as a minimal "consumer" node.

* **OS:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.3
* **Hostname:** `web01.chinmaytech.local`
* **IP Configuration:**
* **IP Address:** `192.168.70.20`
* **DNS:** `192.168.70.10` (Crucial: It must rely on Infra for name resolution)


* **Partitioning Strategy:**
* During installation, we reserved free space on the volume group (`vg_rhel`) to allow for the creation of separate encrypted partitions in Phase 3.



### 3.4 Local Repository Configuration (HTTP/YUM)

Since the environment has no internet access, the servers cannot reach standard repositories like `cdn.redhat.com`. We solved this by creating a **Local Software Depot** on the Infra Server.

1. **Mounting the Source:** We mounted the RHEL 9 Binary DVD ISO to the Infra Server.
2. **Hosting the Content:** We installed the Apache Web Server (`httpd`) and copied the ISO contents to `/var/www/html/rhel9`.
3. **Client Configuration:** We configured a custom `.repo` file on the Web Client to point to the Infra Server:
```ini
[local-baseos]
name=Local BaseOS
baseurl=http://192.168.70.10/rhel9/BaseOS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1

```


4. **The Result:** The Web Client can now install software (e.g., `dnf install httpd`) by pulling packages directly from the Infra Server over the secure LAN.

5. Step 2: Mount the Disc (Inside Linux)
Open your Terminal on the Infra-Server and run these commands to "insert" the disc into the filesystem.
Bash
# 1. Switch to Root (You will need your password)
su -

# 2. Create a directory to hold the disc data
mkdir -p /var/www/html/rhel9

# 3. Mount the CDROM to that directory
mount /dev/cdrom /var/www/html/rhel9

# 4. Verify you see files (BaseOS and AppStream)
ls /var/www/html/rhel9

Troubleshooting: If mount says "no medium found," check the VMware CD/DVD "Connected" checkbox again, then run mount again.
Step 3: Configure the Local Repo
Now we must tell this server: "Don't go to redhat.com for software. Look at the DVD instead."
We will create a new repository file.
Bash
# 1. Disable all online repositories (if any exist)
rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo

# 2. Create the Local Repo file
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo

Press i to enter Insert Mode, then paste this EXACT text:
Ini, TOML
[Local-BaseOS]
name=RHEL 9 BaseOS
baseurl=file:///var/www/html/rhel9/BaseOS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

[Local-AppStream]
name=RHEL 9 AppStream
baseurl=file:///var/www/html/rhel9/AppStream
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

Save and Exit: Press Esc, then type :wq and hit Enter.
Step 4: Install & Configure Apache (The "Server" Part)
Now that the server can install software from the DVD, let's install the Web Server (httpd) so it can share these files with the Client VM later.
Bash
# 1. Clean the cache and list repos
dnf clean all
dnf repolist
# (You should see 'Local-BaseOS' and 'Local-AppStream' listed with a green verification)

# 2. Install Apache
dnf install httpd -y

# 3. Start Apache and make it run at boot
systemctl enable --now httpd

# 4. Open the Firewall (Port 80) so the Client can connect later
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --reload
